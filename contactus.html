        <div class="col"> These days, finding creative new date ideas is harder than ever. Whether you're commuting to work or traveling 20 steps from your bed to your makeshift desk and back again, most of us just don't have a lot of creative juices left over when the day is all over. Some of us have probably watched the entirety of our Netflix queues by now and if you're like me, your couch has a you-shaped imprint in it from all of the quality time you're spending together. And if you've got kids learning from home or in-person (or some mix of the two) that's a whole other level of complication.

          But if you're really lucky, you've got someone who loves you and wants to hang out with you, even if that often means staring at the same screen for the millionth day in a row. Fortunately, we've got enough options to last you a few year's worth of weekends.
